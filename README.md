# Infinite-Crunch-Time
A game made for the Iloilo DevCon 2025   </br>

Infinite Crunch Time is a simulates the career, challenges and creativity of a game developer’s life. Players are tasked with debugging and creating art to be submitted to the boss and employees on a daily basis. 
The programming and debugging aspect is represented through the use of a fill-in the blank mini-game where players fix logic errors and trace bugs, simulating the problem-solving nature of coding. Complementing this is a diamond art–style system for creating visual assets, offering a relaxing yet rewarding creative outlet. The central loop of the gameplay consists of tasks being done by the player, with the efficiency of producing art and debugging minigames determining the pay of the player each day. Your performance determines your ending, which can range from being blacklisted in the industry to becoming an indie studio founder.
